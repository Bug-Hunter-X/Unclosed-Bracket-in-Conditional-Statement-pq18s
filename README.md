# Unclosed Bracket in Conditional Statement

This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: an unclosed bracket in a conditional statement.  The code in `bug.py` contains this error.  The corrected code is in `bugSolution.py`.

**Problem:** The `function_with_unclosed_bracket` function has a missing closing parenthesis in the `if` statement's conditional expression. This will likely cause an `IndentationError` or similar syntax error during execution.

**Solution:** The solution is simpleâ€”add the missing closing parenthesis to properly close the conditional expression.
